port number is 3939<br/>
ip address can be gotten from ipconfig (make sure computer and andriod device are on the same network/ portforwarding is setup properly)<br/>
long press on button/ canvas to change settings<br/>
pressing buttons, gestures on the canvas(fling, double tap, single tap) sends macros<br/>
gestures only work with strict palm rejection<br/>
<br/>
i recommend bulding in android studio although apk does exist under releases
